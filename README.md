# Jacquie's Mac Setup Scripts & Things

## But why though?
I need to set up another machine and likely will need to update my personal one which is super out of date, so it'd be nice to get a repeatable process for this. 

I'm expecting this repo to take me from a relatively (or completely) fresh OS to mostly set up with minimal time spent on each set up.
